      <h3>Let's build something awesome together.</h3>
      <p>
        2 years of learning, coding, problem making, problem solving and coffee
        have led to this, a capable, highly motivated developer with an itch to
        do more.
        <br />
        <br />
        From beautiful Frontend apps with React, to intricate Backend services
        with Node.js, I thrive on tackling complex problems with elegant
        solutions. Core javascript principles are the foundation of my
        knowledge. Fundamentals first, the rest will come.

        can do together.
